# Universal Web App

Welcome to **Universal Web App**, a web application that seamlessly blends Single Page Application (SPA) and Multi-Page Application (MPA) paradigms. This project combines client-side interactivity with server-side routing and rendering, providing a versatile web experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dannycahyo/universal-web-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd universal-web-app
   ```
   
3. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the application:
<!-- TODO: Update the README of this section -->

   ```sh
   node app.js
   ```

   This will run the application in development mode. You also can use nodemon if you want to. 

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the SPA.

    And that's it.

## Branches
