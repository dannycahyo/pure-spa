# Pure SPA

Welcome to **Pure SPA**, a simple web app built with pure vanilla JavaScript for creating an interactive single-page application (SPA). This project consists of three main files: `index.html`, `index.js`, and `server.js`.

## Project Files

### 1. `index.html`

This is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point to your single-page application. It contains the basic structure of the app and links to your JavaScript file for interactivity.

### 2. `index.js`

This JavaScript file contains the logic for handling the DOM (Document Object Model) and adding interactivity to your web app.

### 3. `server.js`

`server.js` is a Node.js script responsible for serving the HTML file (`index.html`). It creates an HTTP server that listens on a specified port and responds to incoming requests by sending the contents of `index.html` with the appropriate MIME type. This is a minimal server setup suitable for development purposes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `node server.js` to start the development server.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the Pure Spa app in action.

## Notes

- This project is intended for learning purposes and demonstrates how to build a basic single-page application using vanilla JavaScript.
- You can extend this project by adding more pages, improving the UI, or integrating APIs for dynamic content.
